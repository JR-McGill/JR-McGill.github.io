## Basic Psychological Needs Are Associated With Engagement and Hate Term Use in Extremist Chatrooms
This projecct used a natural language processing approach to assess expression of three psychological needs (Competence, Autonomy, and Relatedness), and their association with expressed hate (i.e. the use of hate terms) among ~90,000 users from 233 leaked far-right chatrooms on the popular messaging platform Discord. Results showed that increased expression of Competence and Autonomy was associated with more activity and less hate term use on these chatrooms, while increased expression of Relatedness as associated with less activity but more hate term use.

## The Role of Basic Psychological Needs in Right-Wing Extremism Risk Among American Conservatives
This project assessed the relationship between three psychological needs (Competence, Autonomy, and Relatedness) and extremist attitudes among a sample of conservative-identifying participants in the United States. Results demonstrated that these needs explained incremental variance in extremist attitutes beyond stable factors such as personality, psychopathy, and trait-like aggression. Relationships were similar acorss men and women, and patterns of associations were near identical for different ideological groups.
